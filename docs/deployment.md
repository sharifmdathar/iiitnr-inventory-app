# Deployment

The production deployment runs on the IIITNR server behind Caddy, with the
backend and PostgreSQL in a Podman Compose stack.

```

- **Caddy** terminates TLS and serves the static web client from `/srv/web`.
- **backend** is the Fastify API, exposed only on the internal Docker network.
- **db** is PostgreSQL, reachable only from the backend container.
- The Compose stack lives in `backend/compose.prod.yaml`.

## Configuration

`backend/.env` is loaded into the container via `env_file`. The variables that
matter in production are listed in `backend/.env.example`; at minimum:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` **or** `DB_USER` + `DB_PASSWORD` | The Compose file builds `DATABASE_URL=postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@db:5432/iiitnr_inventory` from the credentials, and uses them to initialise the database container |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signs auth tokens — must not be the placeholder value |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google sign-in (without it that route returns 500) |
| `SMTP_*` | Optional — only needed for the expiry / late-fee emails, see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#email) |
| `MAIL_ENABLED` | Set to `true` to actually send. Until then the mail sweeps only log what they would send |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | CORS allow-list for the web client |

## Deploying

```bash
just deploy        # git pull + deploy-web + rebuild the backend container
just deploy-web    # build the web client and publish it to /srv/web
```

`just deploy` does three things:

1. `git pull` — picks up the latest commit on `main`
2. `just deploy-web` — builds the Kotlin/Wasm web client and copies it to `/srv/web`
   (requires `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` in `backend/.env`)
3. `podman compose -f backend/compose.prod.yaml up --build -d --force-recreate backend`
   — rebuilds and recreates the backend container

The database container is **not** recreated, so data is preserved. Migrations run
automatically on container start (`bun run migrate`).

## TLS certificates

Caddy reads its certificates from `backend/certs/` (gitignored). Caddy's own
`Caddyfile` handles the `inventory.iiitnr.ac.in` domain and serves
`/srv/web` for static assets.

## Releases

```bash
just release 1.2.3   # pushes to main and creates a GitHub release with generated notes
```

Releases trigger the GitHub Actions release workflow, which publishes the
Android, Windows and Linux builds — the same artefacts linked from the
"Download App" section of the README.

## Rollback

```bash
git revert <sha> && just deploy
```

Because the database is not recreated on deploy, rollbacks only affect the
application code. Schema changes are additive migrations; a revert that touches
the schema needs a matching migration.
