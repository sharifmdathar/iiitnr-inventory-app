An **Inventory & Item Issue-Return Management System** for the **International
Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur (IIITNR)**. Students request
lab components under a faculty supervisor's approval, get them scanned out and
back in by QR code, and the system tracks stock, due dates, renewals and an
immutable audit trail for every action.

The client is a cross-platform **Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform**
app (Android, Desktop, iOS, Web) talking to a **Fastify + Bun + Drizzle ORM +
PostgreSQL** backend.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 Role-Based Auth & Profiles (RBAC)
- **Multi-Role Matrix:** Features strict role-based verification supporting five tiers: `STUDENT`, `LA` (Lab Assistant), `FACULTY`, `ADMIN`, and `PENDING`.
  - **`ADMIN`:** Full access across the system — component CRUD & images, request fulfillment/lifecycle, user management (search users, change roles/batches/branches), and exclusive access to the immutable audit log ledger.
  - **`LA` (Lab Assistant):** Inventory operations & request fulfillment — component CRUD & images, QR-code scanning, issuing/partially issuing approved requests, returning/partially returning items, and exporting CSV data.
  - **`FACULTY`:** Component catalog viewing & CSV export, supervision and approval/rejection of student project requests and renewal requests nominated to them.
  - **`STUDENT`:** Component catalog browsing, submitting item issue and renewal requests nominated under faculty supervisors, and tracking/retracting personal requests.
  - **`PENDING`:** New registrations awaiting administrator role verification.
- **Automatic Batch/Branch Derivation:** Student batch (graduation range, e.g., `2024-2028`) and branch (`CSE`, `ECE`, `DSAI`) are derived automatically from their institutional email address during signup or profile fetches.
- **Domain Gatekeeping:** Restricts registration/login to IIITNR emails via `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` configuration (e.g., `@iiitnr.edu.in`), protecting college resources.
- **User Management Panel:** Provides administrators with a user panel to search registered accounts and update user details (names, roles, batches, and branches).

### 📦 Lab & Component Catalog Management
- **Hierarchical Layout:** Components organized by categories (`Sensors`, `Actuators`, `Microcontrollers`, `Microprocessors`, `Others`).
- **Real-time Stock Auditing:** Separates `totalQuantity` from `availableQuantity` dynamically, updating automatically as items are requested, approved, and returned.
- **Cross-Platform Image Workflow:** Component images can be selected on Android, Desktop, and iOS, uploaded to the backend, and recorded in the audit log when they change.
- **Upload Guardrails:** Image uploads are restricted to common formats (`JPEG`, `PNG`, `WEBP`, `GIF`, `AVIF`) and capped at `10 MB`.
- **Platform-Native Data Export:** Built-in tool to export the component database to a CSV file from the client top bar (uses platform-specific storage on Android and Desktop).

### 🔄 Multi-State Issue, Return & Renewal System
- **Project Nominated Issues:** Students issue items under specific project titles and name a nominating `FACULTY` supervisor.
- **Resumable Drafts:** The request a student is assembling is kept on the device, so a restart, a crash or an app killed in the background never loses the selected items, quantities, project title or supervisor.
- **QR-Based Fulfillment:** Admins and LAs can fulfill and return requests instantly by scanning a student's unique Request QR code.
- **Fulfillment & Due Tracking:** Approved requests are fulfilled by admins/LAs, automatically setting a 30-day return due date (`returnDueAt`).
- **Auto-Expiry:** Fulfilled or renewed requests past their `returnDueAt` are automatically marked `EXPIRED` by a periodic background sweep.
- **Request Renewals:** Students can submit renewal requests with a detailed reason, allowing nominating faculty or admins/LAs to extend the due date by another 30 days.
- **Automatic Stock Restocking:** Returning components automatically increments `availableQuantity` on the backend, checking against `totalQuantity`.
- **Partial Issue & Return:** Admins/LAs can issue/return specific quantities per item when stock is limited or partial returns occur. Requests track `fulfilledQuantity` per item with `PARTIALLY_ISSUED` and `PARTIALLY_RETURNED` statuses, enabling multi-step fulfillment and granular inventory control.
- **Expiry Write-Off:** Items that are still outstanding when a request expires are written off the component stock in the same transaction, and the adjustment is recorded in the audit log.
- **Notifications:** Every request event (submission, approval, issue, return, expiry, renewal) raises an in-app notification for the student, the faculty supervisor and the lab staff.
- **Email Reminders:** An optional SMTP integration emails the student a reminder 7 days before the return due date, chases the nominating faculty member when a renewal request goes unanswered, notifies the lab when a request expires and stock is written off, and reports the late-return charge on a day 1/3/7/14/30 ladder.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Admin Audit Logging
- **Admin-Exclusive Immutable Ledger:** Records all system activities like `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `LOGIN`, `LOGOUT`, `REQUEST_STATUS_CHANGE`, and `INVENTORY_ADJUST`. Only Administrators have permission to query and view audit logs.
- **System-Wide Accountability:** Stores state changes using highly detailed diffs (`oldValues` and `newValues`), tracking IP addresses, and user-agent details for advanced security audits.

### 🔄 Automatic Version Compatibility Check
- **Synchronized Deployments:** Startup compatibility check that calls the server version endpoint (`GET /version`), matching it using semantic version comparisons.
- **In-App Upgrades:** Displays a Snackbar banner to download updates from the GitHub Releases page if a newer server version is detected.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is structured into a modern decoupled architecture. The frontend application shares Core logic, models, and network API layer across all targets (Desktop, Android, and iOS) via Kotlin Multiplatform, and connects over HTTP/JSON with the Fastify/PostgreSQL backend server.

## 🔄 Issue & Return Request Lifecycle

A request moves through an automated state machine — `PENDING` → `APPROVED` →
`ISSUED` / `PARTIALLY_ISSUED` → `RETURNED` / `PARTIALLY_RETURNED`, with
`REQUESTED_RENEW` / `RENEWED` for extensions and `EXPIRED` when the due date
passes without a full return.

The complete diagram, the status reference and the background sweeps that drive
expiry and renewal reminders are in
[docs/request-lifecycle.md](docs/request-lifecycle.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start & Development Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your developer machine:
- [Bun Runtime](https://bun.sh/) (v1.3.11+)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) (Required for KMP compilation)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (For launching the database)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) task runner (Optional, but highly recommended)

For the client targets you also need: **Android Studio** (with a device or
emulator) for Android, **Xcode** on macOS for iOS, and the **Android SDK
platform tools** (`adb`) for `just andro`.

---

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Copy `backend/.env.example` and fill in the blanks:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

   **Required** — the backend will not start without these:

   | Variable | Purpose |
   |---|---|
   | `JWT_SECRET` | Signs auth tokens — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
   | `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string — set this when pointing at an existing database |
   | `DB_USER` + `DB_PASSWORD` | **Alternative to** `DATABASE_URL` (if want to use local postgres DB with compose)


4. **Spin up a local PostgreSQL Instance (via Podman Compose):**
   ```bash
   just db-up
   ```

5. **Generate & Apply Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   bun run migrate
   ```

6. **Create the Initial Admin User:**
   ```bash
   bun run seed
   ```
   The seed script creates one `ADMIN` account. The password is printed to the
   console — it is generated randomly unless `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set in `.env`.

7. **Start the API Server (Development Mode):**
   ```bash
   just dev
   ```
   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

---

### Kotlin Multiplatform App Setup

The frontend app shares the core UI and logic in `app/shared`, while platform specific runners exist for Desktop, Android, and iOS.

#### 1. Running the Compose Desktop Client
You can run the Desktop application immediately using the preconfigured gradle task:
```bash
cd app
./gradlew desktop:run
```
*(Or simply run `just desk` from the project root)*

#### 2. Running the Android Client
Open the `app` directory in **Android Studio**. Make sure the target emulator or physical device is connected, and select the `android` module configuration and click **Run**.

*Note: the Android **debug** build points at the hosted backend
(`app/shared/src/androidMain/.../DevBaseUrl.android.kt`), while the desktop and
web debug builds point at `http://localhost:4000`. To use a local backend from
an Android emulator, change `devBaseUrl()` to `http://10.0.2.2:4000` — that is
how the emulator reaches the host machine.*

*Or from the command line, with a device connected via adb:*
```bash
just andro
```

#### 3. Running the iOS Client
Prerequisites: macOS with Xcode installed. Open the `/app/iosApp` project workspace inside Xcode, configure your developer certs, select a simulated iOS device, and press **Cmd + R**.

#### 4. Running the Web (WasmJs) Client
You can run the Web application in development mode with hot-reload:
```bash
cd app
./gradlew :web:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
```
*(Or simply run `just web` from the project root)*

---
